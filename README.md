# HELP KRISH
(Time limit : 1s per test)
Krish likes candies a lot. His friends Tokas and Paras give him a challenge wherein he can earn candies. All Krish has to do is carry out a few instructions given to him.   
As a part of his task, Krish has to walk on stepping stones. Each stepping stone has an energy cost(Ai) associated with it, which is the energy Krish spends if he steps on it. In a particular instruction, Krish has to go from stone a to stone b, where a and b will be given. Krish will start at a given stone.If Krish is already on a stone (the starting stone for an instruction), he doesn't  have to spend energy corresponding to that stone. For eg, if Krish wants to go from stone 0 to stone 2, he has to spend energy corresponding to stones 1 and 2.  
For each instruction that Krish completes, Tokas and Paras give him one candy.
## Input  
 
The first line contains an integer n, the number of stones(n<=10^5) and the total number of instructions t(<=10^5)  
The next line of each test case contains n integers(the costs of the stones).(0<= Ai <= 10^9)  
Next line contains (t + 1) integers. The first integer gives the starting point of Krish, and each subsequent integer contains the next stone he has to go to
